Image Processing project 

-To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:
1-Face Detection and Data Gathering.
2-Train the Recognizer.
3-Face Recognition. 

- And the detected students get their names written on an excel sheet for attendance. 
- The code can be run from outside by just pressing on the python file so itâ€™s very easy to deal with. 

- This work is made by : 

1-Reham Reda

4-Mohamad Abd Elraouf
