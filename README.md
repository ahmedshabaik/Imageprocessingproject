Image Processing project 

-To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:
Face Detection and Data Gathering
Train the Recognizer
Face Recognition 

- And the detected students get their names written on an excel sheet for attendance 
- The code can be run from outside by just pressing on the python file so it’s very easy to deal with. 

- This work is made by :
